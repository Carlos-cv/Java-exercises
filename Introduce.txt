- Tell me about yourself
I'm a person that likes to learn new topics and seek to have high level of knowledge, as shown with my certification on Azure. I got used to changes on my daily tasks which require to continue learning. I worked as a support engineer, on my daily tasks I have to make sure that the environments where the application was hosted are working correctly, but I always wanted to be able to create and modify the current feature of an application, also I like to be able to write and test my work which is the reason of why I decide to make my change to the developer area. 

- What was your tasks on your previous job
On my previous job I had to build and deploy customer packages using an automatic tool and linux commands on the servers at least once each week. Also I had to do troubleshooting when there is unexpected downtimes on an environment which with the high amount of customers it was a daily task and perform the adecuate fix which some examples include a restart of the services, create and modifie the redirect rules properties for each domain and in case the environment is hosted on Azure, adjustement of the memory of the kubernetes pods and diagnosted the error and communicate with the team who can handle it further.
